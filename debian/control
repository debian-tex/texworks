Description: Environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents
 An environment for authoring TeX (LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc) documents, with
 a Unicode-based, TeX-aware editor, integrated PDF viewer, and a clean,
 simple interface accessible to casual and non-technical users.

 Mac OS X, which has made quality typesetting through TeX accessible to
 a wider community of users, without a technical or intimidating face.
 The goal of TeXworks is to deliver a similarly integrated, easy-to-use
 environment for users on other platforms, especially GNU/Linux and Windows.
